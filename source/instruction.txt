1. **Detect when the user is setting a new hotkey**

   * For example, when the user clicks a “Change Hotkey” button or a modal input field opens, you enter a *“listening”* state.
   * You can show a message like “Press a key or mouse button to set your new hotkey.”

2. **Listen for key or mouse events in the window**

   * Use `document.addEventListener("keydown", ...)` for keyboard keys.
   * Use `document.addEventListener("mousedown", ...)` for mouse buttons.
   * When one of these fires, you capture the `event.key` (like `"F6"` or `"a"`) or the `event.button` (0 = left, 1 = middle, 2 = right).

3. **Stop listening after one input**

   * Once a key or button is pressed, you remove the event listeners so you don’t accidentally record multiple inputs.
   * You can then display the captured key/button on the UI.

4. **Send the new hotkey to the main process via IPC**

   * Use `ipcRenderer.send("updateHotkey", hotkeyValue)` to inform the main process.
   * The main process can then re-register the shortcut with `globalShortcut.register()` (when you actually need it to be global).

5. **Optional: handle validation**

   * You can ignore modifier-only keys (`Shift`, `Ctrl`, etc.) or prevent duplicate hotkeys.






Here’s exactly how to copy (clone) your GitHub repository onto a new machine — step by step, no assumptions:

---

### **1. Install Git**

If you haven’t already:

* Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Download and install Git for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
* During install on Windows, select “Add Git to PATH” when asked

---

### **2. Get the Repository URL**

* Go to your repository on GitHub
* Click the **green “Code”** button
* Under “Clone,” copy the **HTTPS URL** (it looks like this):

  ```
  https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
  ```

---

### **3. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**

* On **Windows**: open *Git Bash* or *Command Prompt*
* On **macOS/Linux**: open *Terminal*

---

### **4. Navigate to Where You Want the Project**

For example, if you want it in your Documents folder:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

(On Windows PowerShell: `cd "C:\Users\YourName\Documents"`)

---

### **5. Clone the Repository**

Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

This creates a new folder with your project’s files.

---

### **6. Go Into the Project Folder**

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

---

### **7. Install Dependencies (if it’s a Node/Electron project)**

If your project has a `package.json`, run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download all dependencies.

---

### **8. Verify Everything Works**

Run your Electron app (or whatever your project uses):

```bash
npm start
```
